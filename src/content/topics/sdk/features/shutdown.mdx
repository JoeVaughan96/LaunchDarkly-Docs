## Overview

This topic explains how to safely shut down different LaunchDarkly SDKs. This feature is available for both client-side and server-side SDKs.

## Shutting down an SDK

LaunchDarkly SDKs provide language-specific methods to shut down their instances safely. In most applications, you do not have to manually shut down an SDK.

When your application is about to terminate, shut down the LaunchDarkly client. This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that it delivers any pending analytics to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events.

Do not attempt to use the LaunchDarkly client after it has shut down, as doing so may result in undefined behavior. Shut down the client at a point in your application's lifecycle where the client is no longer needed.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [C/C++ (client-side)](#cc-client-side)
* [Electron](#electron)
* [Flutter](#flutter)
* [iOS](#ios)
* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [Node.js (client-side)](#nodejs-client-side)
* [React Native](#react-native)

### .NET (client-side)

`Dispose` safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `Dispose`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
client.Dispose();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Android

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
    { label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
client.close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### C/C++ (client-side)

To fully uninitialize the C/C++ SDK resources, you must use `close`. The operation blocks until all resources are free. It is not safe to use any API methods after this process is initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientClose(client);
```

</CodeTabItem>

<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
client->close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Electron

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
await client.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Flutter

Optionally, if your application will no longer use the client, it may permanently shut down the client with `close`. This is not generally required, but is provided to clear any resources associated with the SDK and cleanly shut down.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
await LDClient.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### iOS

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
client.close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
[client close];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### JavaScript

To shut down the JavaScript SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
await client.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Node.js (client-side)

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
await client.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### React Native

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
await client.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Server-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following server-side SDKs:

* [.NET (server-side)](#net-server-side)
* [C/C++ (server-side)](#cc-server-side)
* [Erlang](#erlang)
* [Go](#go)
* [Haskell](#haskell)
* [Java](#java)
* [Node.js (server-side)](#nodejs-server-side)
* [Python](#python)
* [Ruby](#ruby)

### .NET (server-side)

[`Dispose`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_LdClient_Dispose_) safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `Dispose`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: '.NET', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
client.Dispose();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### C/C++ (server-side)

`LDClientClose` uninitializes the resources the C/C++ SDK uses. The operation blocks until all resources are free. It is not safe to use any API methods after this process is initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientClose(client);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Erlang

`stop_instance()`, `stop_instance(Tag)`, and `stop_all_instance()` all safely shut down client instances and releases the resources associated with them.

In most long-running applications, you will not have to call these functions. You can use them to ensure all events have been flushed synchronously before closing your application.

Do not evaluate flags after any of these functions have been initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```erlang
ldclient:stop_all_instances()

% Stops the default instance
ldclient:stop_instance()

% Stops a named instance
ldclient:stop_instance(my_instance)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Go

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
client.Close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Haskell

`close` safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client.

In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `close`, but you can use it to ensure all events have been flushed synchronously before closing your application.

You should not evaluate flags after `close` has been initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="haskell"
  values={[
    { label: 'Haskell', value: 'haskell', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="haskell">

```haskell
close client
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Java

[`Close`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/java-server-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/LDClient.html#close--) safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `close`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
